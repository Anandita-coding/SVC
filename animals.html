Many people who were deaf and yet were successful for e.g. Thomas Edison, Helen Keller and Ludwig Van Beethoven.
For being successful people need to be knowledgeable and skillful, for knowledge people need to communicate, read and write... Deaf people learn best visually. That means we learn letters and words by visual memory and associating it with its corresponding ASL sign and/or image. So I think that this website will help them


People need to have resources for studying so I have gathered as many possible resources and put them in this website also I hope to make this website more user friendly and better
